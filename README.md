## Planned Additions
- Further flesh out the workout creation interface to allow for more customizability (adding super sets, setting variations to reps, etc.)
- Add a step-by-step interface that iterates through and records a user's workout
- Introduce some competition by giving the option for users to add a gym to their profile, and setting leaderboards for gyms

- Strengthened my knowledge in data base structuring and retrieval
- The application of **npm** packages can save hours of time
- The ability to read and thoroughly understand new API documentation
